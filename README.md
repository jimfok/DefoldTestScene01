# Defold Scene Test

This repository contains a test project for creating scenes in Defold using collections and game objects.
At the moment it consists only of an empty mobile project generated from the Defold template.

The template settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) include:

- The screen size set to 640x1136
- The projection set to Fixed Fit
- Orientation fixed vertically
- Android and iOS icons
- The `touch` action bound to mouse click or single touch
- A simple script reacting to input
- Accelerometer input turned off for better battery life

[Build and run](defold://build) to see it in action. You can alter these settings to fit your needs.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
